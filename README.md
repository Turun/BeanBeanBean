# BeanBeanBean
scripting for africa

requires Selenium and a driver

this script will go to https://beanbeanbean.com/times-tables.html and solve the equation. once it reached the first goal it will donate the beans and start all over again. If you should modify this script I highly recommend to regulary donate the beans, otherwise the site will slow the script down significantly.
